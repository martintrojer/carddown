Let's start with some basic micro cards:

Who was the first president of the USA? : George Washington ðŸ§ 

You can also create decks with micro cards by adding various tags:

How many people are bitten by snakes each year? : 5.3M ðŸ§  #nature #travel
How many people die each year from snake bites? : ~130k ðŸ§  #nature #travel

Now let's create some more complex cards.

We end the card with a horizontal line which can defined with :
\-\-\-, \- \- \-, \*\*\*, \* \* \*

Let's try:
Radii of stable orbits in the Bohr model #flashcard #physics

a0  = h2 / (m_e k e^2)

The electron is able to revolve in certain stable orbits around the nucleus without radiating any energy, contrary to what classical electromagnetism suggests
