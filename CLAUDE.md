# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `cargo build` - Build the project
- `cargo test` - Run all tests
- `cargo run -- scan <path>` - Extract flashcards from files/folders
- `cargo run -- revise` - Start interactive study session
- `cargo run -- audit` - Review orphaned/leech cards
- `cargo install --path .` - Install locally

## Architecture Overview

Carddown is a CLI flashcard system with spaced repetition that extracts cards from text files.

**Core Data Flow:**
1. Scan text files â†’ Parse flashcards â†’ Store in JSON database
2. Revise session â†’ Filter due cards â†’ Present in TUI â†’ Update statistics
3. Audit mode â†’ Show problematic cards â†’ Allow cleanup

**Key Components:**

- **Card parsing** (`card.rs`): Extracts flashcards from markdown using content hashing (blake3) for identification. Supports single-line format `Question : Answer ðŸ§  #tag` and multi-line with `---`/`***` separators.

- **Database** (`db.rs`): JSON-based storage in `~/.local/state/carddown/` tracking card metadata, review history, and statistics. Handles orphaned cards and leech detection.

- **Spaced repetition** (`algorithm/`): Implements SM2, SM5, and Simple8 algorithms with quality grades 0-5 where 0-2 are failures that reset progress.

- **Terminal UI** (`view/`): Interactive sessions built with `ratatui` and `crossterm` for reviewing (`revise.rs`) and auditing (`audit.rs`) cards.

**Important Patterns:**
- Cards identified by content hash, survive file moves
- Human-readable JSON storage, no binary formats
- Lock mechanism prevents concurrent instances
- Incremental scanning only checks modified files by default
